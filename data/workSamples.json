Every one of these tasks were programmed in Python, utilizing various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The brunt of the project consisted of cleaning and transforming the data, which required the use of analytical thinking in order to ascertain the transformations and cleaning required. At the very end of the mentorship, we were instructed to put together an informative presentation to give to our peers, which required various learned presentation design skills, such as proper headlines, trackers, and useful charts.",

During the project, each group was instructed to create a project planner to organize and visualize their progress, detailing all the tasks each member of the group was to work on. Finally, at the end of the project we were to create poster boards with information on our games, as a form of advertisement, and present them in an open-house style format to students who came by. Additionally, our teacher held a voting station where viewers of the presentations could vote on which game they found to be most enjoyable, which Forlorn ended up winning 1st place.",
